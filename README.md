# kde-auto-ricer
KDE Ricing Script, this realistically exists far more for my personal use than to show off, this isn't really much of a nice/fancy script. I've two copies, one adds g810-led support given I like my keyboard to change to match my ricing.

## Dependencies

[pywal-kde](https://github.com/the404devs/pywal-kde) Needed to get pywal to work nicely with KDE (barring if these changes have been merged into main pywal)
[plasma-theme-switcher](https://github.com/maldoinc/plasma-theme-switcher/releases/download/v0.1/plasma-theme) Needed for Changing Color Schemes
(Optional)
[g810-led](https://github.com/MatMoul/g810-led)Needed for Keyboard scripts

## Installation/Configuration

I'm a lazy fella, all I'm intending to include is the shell script, template file(s), and some basic instructions, and maybe some other odds and ends of customization, hopefully it's clear enough

```bash

git clone https://github.com/the404devs/pywal-kde.git
cd pywal-kde
pip3 install .
cd ../
rm -rf pywal-kde
#Install needed additional packages for pywal as desired, see [pywal documentation](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation#backends)

wget https://github.com/maldoinc/plasma-theme-switcher/releases/download/v0.1/plasma-theme
#Your choice on where you want this executable to go and who you want to access it, I'm just putting this where I put it
#sudo mv plasma-theme /bin/
#sudo chown root:root /bin/plasma-theme
#sudo chmod +x /bin/plasma-theme

#If Keyboard stuff is something you're interested in and you're using Debian/Ubuntu
#apt install g810-led

#Run wal at least once, it'll generate the needed folders for later steps

git clone https://github.com/wyatt-kinkade/kde-auto-ricer.git
cd kde-auto-ricer
#copy templates to the pywal template directory
cp templates/* ~/.config/wal/templates/
#Copy either the full or partial script for this
cp ./wal-kde-colors.sh ~/bin/
#cp ./wal-kde-colors-lite.sh ~/bin/
#The following links a color scheme for konsole, just make sure to select the theme for konsole... Settings, Edit Current Profile, Appearance Tab, "Colorscheme generated by wal"
ln  ~/.cache/wal/colors-konsole.colorscheme ~/.local/share/konsole
#Link the Color Scheme folder to the correct directory, not a hard requirement, but imo it's good to be organized
ln -s ~/.cache/wal/pywal-kde.colors ~/.local/share/color-schemes/pywal-kde.colors
#Link the color key script to the local bin folder if applicable
ln -s ~/.cache/wal/color-keys.sh ~/bin/color-keys.sh
```
